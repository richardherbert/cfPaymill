		<p>Fed up with PayPal? Frustrated with SagePay? Why not try <a href="http://www.paymill.com/en-gb/">Paymill</a>?</p>

		<p>Paymill is a new generation Payment Service Provider (PSP) that offers an innovative solution to the question of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payment_Card_Industry_Data_Security_Standard">PCI compliance</a> for online retailers.</p>

		<p>Interfacing to the <a href="https://developers.paymill.com/API/">Paymill API</a> is simple for <a href="http://www.adobe.com/uk/products/coldfusion-family.html">Adobe ColdFusion</a>, <a href="http://lucee.org/">Lucee</a> and <a href="http://www.getrailo.org/">Railo</a> developers with the <a href="https://richardherbert.github.io/cfpaymill/">cfPaymill</a> component.</p>

		<p>Take a look at the getting started guide and you'll see how easy it is to integrate Paymill into your shopping cart with the cfPaymill ColdFusion component.</p>

		<p>I've created a Twitter account, <a href="https://twitter.com/cfPaymill">cfPaymill</a> to handle any initial questions you may have. In time there will be a blog and forum to discuss the project.</p>

		<p>In June 2013 I gave a Lightning Talk at the <a href="http://www.sotr.eu/">Scotch on the Rocks</a> ColdFusion conference in Edinburgh and I have <a href="assets/SotR-cfPaymill-Lightning-Talk.pdf" target="_blank">uploaded the slides here</a>.</p>

		<p>Enjoy!</p>

			<h2 class="text-center">getting started</h2>

			<p>First you'll need an <a href="https://app.paymill.com/en-gb/auth/register">account with Paymill</a>. It's free to sign up and you'll get both public and private test API keys which you'll need later on.</p>

			<p>Then build your payment form. You could use the <a href="https://www.paymill.com/en-gb/documentation-3/introduction/payment-form/">Paymill example</a> as a starter. Don't forget to replace the public key in the example with the one given to you when you signed up. Also change the form action value to point to the ColdFusion page that will process the request.<p>

			<p>Visit the cfPaymill page on GitHub, <a href="https://github.com/richardherbert/cfPaymill">download the latest version</a> (currently 0.3.6), then drop the component <code>cfPaymill.cfc</code> into the webroot of your website.</p>

			<p>Finally, in your form action processing page, you just need add...</p>

			<pre>&lt;cfset cfPaymill=createObject("component", "cfPaymill").init(privateKey="8a4d1230504c19caf55d02f150730afa", publicKey="148466278085160bc9d8ee20b29d279f",
apiEndpoint="https://api.paymill.com/v2/")&gt;
&lt;cfset transaction=cfPaymill.addTransaction(card-amount-int,card-currency,form.paymilltoken)&gt;</pre>

			<p>Where <code>my-private-key</code> is replaced with the value given in your account. The values of <code>card-amount-int</code> and <code>card-currency</code> come from your server-side shopping cart and match those hidden fields on the credit card details form. The value of the form scoped variable <code>form.paymillToken</code> is returned from the Paymill Javascript Bridge service.</p>

			<p>What you'll get back in the variable <code>transaction</code> is a structure that contains the data returned from the Paymill API. Try the Demonstration page and see the result returned.</p>

			<p>And that's basically it. Not hard eh!</p>

			<p>Now, of course, there's a lot more that can be done to make your code more efficient and integrated with your chosen development framework. So come back soon and hopefully there'll be more content and examples as time goes on.</p>
